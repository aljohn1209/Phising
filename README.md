Phishing URL Prediction using Gradient Boosting Classifier
This project uses a Gradient Boosting Classifier to predict whether a given URL is phishing or not. The model is trained on a dataset (phishing.csv) to classify URLs as either safe or unsafe. The web application, built using Flask, allows users to input a URL and get a prediction on whether it's safe to visit or potentially a phishing attempt.

Features
URL Prediction: Users can input a URL, and the model will predict if it is safe to visit.

Phishing Probability: The model provides the probability of a URL being phishing or non-phishing.

Technologies Used
Flask: Web framework to build the web application.

Python: Programming language for implementing the machine learning model and web application logic.

Scikit-learn: Machine learning library used to implement the Gradient Boosting Classifier.

Pandas & NumPy: Data manipulation and array handling libraries.

HTML: For rendering the web page and displaying results.
